# Using Wraith Selectors



## Resources

The following resources may be helpful as you complete these exercises:

1. [Casper Mode](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/index.html#CasperMode)
2.

## Assignment

1. Capture baseline image for "Inline Images with Content" from style guide page
2. Capture baseline image for "Horizontal Tabs" from add ons
3. Capture baseline image for the entire form from the layout form page
4. Capture baseline image for the header from the layout sidebar left page

### Extra Credit

Use [before capture](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/index.html#beforeCapturehooks) JavaScript to
change the "Horizontal Tab" to the 2nd tab, and take another baseline image.

## Conclusion

While Wraith's scripting ability is not as powerful as other tools, the combination of ease of use with essential element selection makes it a very useful tool to have in your repertoire.
