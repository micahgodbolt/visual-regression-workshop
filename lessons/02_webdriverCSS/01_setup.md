## Assignment

1. Install Selenium Using one of the first 3 resources (#3 is the most recommended)
2. Install Webdriver CSS and Webdriver IO (npm install?)
- Add a webdrivercss folder to the root of the project and create a webdrivercss.js file in it
- Follow this [WebdriverCSS example](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss#example) and write tests for the `.site-header` and `.site-content` of the "Full Width Layout"
- Start up Selenium Server using `selenium-server -port 4444`
- In a seperate terminal window run the tests by typing `node webdrivercss/webdrivercss.js` from the root of the project

### Tips

1. Don't forget to change the `res.foo` value to match the name of your test

### Extra Credit
1. Create additional tests for each major section on the page (Article header, image, Related Items)
2. Turn the "break-some-thins" sass partial off, run the tests, then turn it back on and run them again.
