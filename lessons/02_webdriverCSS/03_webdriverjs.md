## Assignment

### Move & Click

1. Write a test to capture the `.slider` on the "add ons" page.
2. Then move the mouse over the third control circle, and test the slider again
3. Thirdly, click on third control and test the slider a 3rd time

### Interact with Form

4. Start a test for the "sample form" page, and test the entire form
5. Then interact with the form. Add "Hello from CSS Dev Conf" to `#text01`
6. Select "Item Five" from `#select01`
7. Create a second test with the form in its new state

### Pause and Waiting

9. On the "add-ons" page, click on "Image One" of the "Modal Dialog" then wait until the modal "is visible" before testing
10. Go back to your Slider test and add a "pause" of 600ms to account for the animation

### Extra Credit

8. Test the style-guide but replace the "Section Heading Linked {h2}", Sub-section Heading {h3} and Sub-sub-section Heading {h4} with multi-line titles (A little hipster ipsum works well here)
