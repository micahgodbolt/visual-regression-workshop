# Adding Commands

## Resources

The following resources may be helpful as you complete these exercises:

- [WebdriverIO Custom Commands](http://webdriver.io/guide/usage/customcommands.html)

## Assignment

1. Create your own command and use it in your tests.

### Extra Credit

Using Node `module.exports`, you can move your commands to an external file (to be loaded by your tests). Follow the examples in the Webdriver.io code to move your command to a separate file: [Command File](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/examples/commands/webdriverio.externalAddCommandHelper.js), [Test file](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/examples/commands/webdriverio.addCommand.js)
